- ✅ Calculate risk metrics and volatility analysis

### Implementation Details:

#### 1.1 Data Fetching and Cleaning
```python
# Fetch data from YFinance (2015-2025)
symbols = ['TSLA', 'BND', 'SPY']
start_date = '2015-07-01'
end_date = '2025-07-31'

# Data includes: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adj Close
# Missing values handled using forward-fill method
# Data validated for completeness and quality
```

#### 1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
**Key Visualizations Generated:**
- Stock price trends over time
- Daily returns distribution
- Rolling volatility analysis
- Correlation heatmaps
- Q-Q plots for normality testing

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Summary statistics for each asset
- Risk metrics: VaR, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown
- Stationarity testing using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- Outlier detection using Z-score and IQR methods

#### 1.3 Key Findings:
- **TSLA**: High volatility (60-80% annualized), strong growth trend
- **BND**: Low volatility (5-8% annualized), stable income generation
- **SPY**: Moderate volatility (15-20% annualized), market correlation
- **Correlations**: TSLA shows low correlation with BND/SPY, providing diversification benefits

#### 2.2 LSTM Neural Network
```python
# Architecture: 2 LSTM layers with dropout
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(60, 1)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(1)
])
# Features: 60-day lookback window, sequence-based forecasting
# Training: 50 epochs with early stopping
```

#### 2.3 Model Comparison Results
**Performance Comparison:**
- ARIMA typically performs better for short-term forecasts

# Confidence intervals: 95% confidence level
# Trend analysis: Bullish/Bearish classification
# Volatility forecasting: Expected market conditions
```

#### 3.2 Trend Analysis
**Forecast Interpretation:**
- **Trend Direction**: Bullish/Bearish classification based on expected returns

expected_returns = {
    'TSLA': forecasted_return,
    'BND': historical_bnd_return,
    'SPY': historical_spy_return
}
```

#### 4.2 Portfolio Optimization
**Optimization Approaches:**
